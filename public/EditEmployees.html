        <p>
            Performing CRUD operations in the MongoDB cloud database using NodeJS
        </p>

        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this experiment is to learn how to utilize MongoJS package and do CRUD operations on NodeJS.
            I had to mostly worry about asynchronous callbacks that were a real headache initially, until I got a 
            grasp of the technology and how it works in NodeJS, since this is my first tryst with blocking calls.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have a website that adds, deletes, reads and updates the data in the website database. I have fully
            utilized <b>HTTP "POST" and "GET"</b> calls to make this work and have learnt quite a lot about this 
            API. I am moving with an assumption that this experiment will be a key one for me to understand
            and implement my project design.
        </p>
        <p>
            I have also employed <b>Angular Scoping and Dirty classes</b> to make sure that I dynamically update the 
            data from the text boxes on the fly. This was a pretty cool feature of angular that I really liked.
